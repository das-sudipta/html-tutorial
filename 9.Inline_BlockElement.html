<!--Inline elements are those elements which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of element. On the other hand, block-level elements take up the entire space of its parent element.

the paragraph tag is a block element. The Block element means that it will take the full width of a single line and does not allow any other content to fit in it. But, if we write both the texts between the <span> tags like-
    <span>This is a paragraph</span> <span>This is also a paragraph</span>
Then we see that both the texts will appear in the same line. It is because the <span> tag is an inline element. It allows all the elements in the same line.

    Anchor <a> tags also behaves like an inline element. -->
