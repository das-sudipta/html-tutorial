<<!--Emmet abbreviation just makes our work easy providing us the basic template of HTML. Abbreviations are the heart of the Emmet toolkit. It comes automatically built-in with Visual Studio Code

There are basically six types of heading tags ranging from <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. These are the six heading tags from h1 being the largest font size and h6 being the smallest font size. In every website there is only one <h1> tag, which is the main heading of the website. You should never write the normal paragraph text as headings just to make it bold. It is advised that using <h1> tag only once will help in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of a website and even ranking it higher in different search engines. 


 Then comes the paragraph tag which is denoted by <p>. Whenever we want to add a paragraph on our website then we can simply use paragraph tag in the format-
      <p>some random texts</p>
To write a new paragraph, simply jump on a new line and start writing the new paragraph in a paragraph tag. To get 4 different lines of paragrapgh tag, we can simply write p*4. 
        
we can write lorem and the number of words we want in a paragraph. Let us understand with an example- <p>Lorem40</p>


The next tags that we are going to see are <strong> and <em> (emphasized) tags. Writing some texts between strong tags will make that portion of the text as bold. And writing any text between em tags, will convert that part as Italic. However, these texts can later be changed with the help of CSS.

Now to change a line in a paragraph we can easily use the <br> tag. It is a self-closing tag which helps to break a line. However, using too many <br> tags is not good for practice. We will discuss this more when we are going to learn CSS.
            <p>first<br><br><br><br>This is a new line</p>


Then the next tag is the <hr> tag which is also a self-closing tag. It helps to add a horizontal ruler like a line on the webpage. 

Apart from these there are also Bold and Italic tags also but it is is recommened to use them in HTML 5. It is recommended to use strong and em tags instead. -->
